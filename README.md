* The proposed system is 3-tier architecture in which there are 4 users that is patient, doctor, pathology and admin. When the user first visits Doccure he will be displayed all the available features on the homepage with a navigation bar that would navigate the user to different sections of the web app.
* All the users need to register on the web application as per their role like patient who need healthcare services, Doctor as Health Expert and Pathology Lab as Diagnosis test provider. After Registration Patient can search doctors as per their need and book appointment with doctor. Appointment booking request is shown on the doctor dashboard and doctor can confirm or cancel the appointment. After confirmation from the patient can able to see the appointment date with doctor. Patient can consult with doctor through Chat or Video Call about their health issues and take prescription from the doctor.
* Health expert’s that are doctors can register their self on the Doccure and mention their Specialization, Services and time slots. Doctor also mention their fees and give good health tips to patient. Pathology Lab can register on the system and mentions which diagnosis test are available in their lab. If doctor prescribed to patient to take diagnosis test then patient can book diagnosis test online through our system. After testing pathology lab can send reports to the patient through our system. Patient can view and download test reports from their account.
* Admin can control overall system and see patient doctor and pathology lab data. Admin can authenticate user’s credentials. To store all the data we used MongoDB database. It is document-oriented database program and classified as a NoSQL database program.
